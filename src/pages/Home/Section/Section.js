                    <p>Back in May, Xiaomi sub-brand Redmi announced it sold over 25 million units of the original Redmi Note 8 globally.

                    <p>Phone 13 Pro was made for low light. The Wide camera adds a wider aperture and our largest sensor yet â€” and it leverages the LiDAR Scanner for Night mode portraits. Ultra Wide gets a wider aperture, a faster sensor, and all-new autofocus. And Telephoto now has Night mode.</p>
